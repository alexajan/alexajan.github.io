                I conduct an impact analysis before every big decision. Choices are plotted on two axes, its quantitative effect on a scale from myself to the world population and the qualitative effect on a scale from small acts of kindness to global solutions. The goal is always quadrant I, high quantitative and qualitative impact, so tangibly, I want to have a large positive delta on many people’s lives.

            <p>
                The much harder thing is defining what that impact looks like. To be honest, I don’t know yet, so I’m still learning and understanding the problem(s) at hand. If I can find a problem that aligns with my passions, work becomes less like a 9-to-5 desk job and more of an uphill run – challenging in the moment, but feeling satisfied and stronger at the top. Through this exploration, I’ve learned to both empower and innovate to maximize impact. Empowerment amplifies the impact of my technical contributions, and innovation provides fulfillment, vital skills to take away for the marathon of life.
            <br></p>
            <p>
                For example, shortly after I learned computer science, I realized how much more impact teaching the skill was. Two summers ago, I taught underprivileged students at UTEC in Lima, Peru the basics of Android app and web development. I was not expecting market-ready startups to emerge from a six week bootcamp. Rather, I hoped to instill an entrepreneurial mindset and a foundation of skills for future success. For a few, however, that was enough to catalyze ideas into a full-fledged startup. One of those companies was Iqua, who brings potable, filtered water stations to seven Peruvian towns and counting. Empowered with a strong foundation, graduates have grown into startup founders, changing their community’s lives in better ways than I could even imagine.
            <br></p>
            <p>
                Innovation gives me a sense of purpose within a project. It also gives me an idea of where I want to focus my impact. Through research positions at MIT, I had the opportunity to tackle big problem statements. These contributions to projects and publications will hopefully be stepping stones for the next generation of scholars to bring ideas to fruition. From my work generating a Gazebo simulation of LiDAR car data, I can envision a not-so-distant future with fully autonomous cars that have eliminated rush hour traffic. As I visualized the invariances of a generative adversarial network, I hope it will lead to ethical, unbiased artificial intelligence that has optimized our lives and helps inform our decisions. These one year research explorations represent a purposeful step in the face of ambiguous problem statements.
            <br></p>
            <p>
                At the intersection of innovation and empowerment is product management. The role is at the heart of team-driven feature creation and development. The remainder of the job is empowering others to do their jobs. To garner support for shiny, bold ideas, as well as less glorious but necessary ones. Although the end goal of my impact is still in flux, my values drive me towards a concrete next step: product management.
