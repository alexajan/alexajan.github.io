            <p>
                For the last five years, I have swiped my plastic credit card at cashiers, scoffing at the technologists hell-bent on using their phone for everything, even just paying for a coffee. Then, I saw the Apple Card. Or I heard it, as it fell with a “clink” on my roommate’s desk, a sound that I’m sure was obsessively optimized by the product design team. The physical card was the epitome of Apple’s familiar utilitarian simplicity. The all-white, titanium card bears only an etched Apple logo, your name, and a chip. There is no credit card number printed and therefore, no expiration date or security code. Having had to cancel two credit cards over fraud, I was drawn instantly to the elegant solution. Barring an admittedly strong allegiance toward Apple products, this initial impression was what persuaded me. Two taps later, the card was on its way.

            <p>
                The card was the “foot in the door” to caving into Apple Pay, as much of the added value comes from the seamless iPhone integration. There was a host of small, helpful features awaiting in the wallet app. For example, all purchases and returns trigger a small banner notification. Each transaction is geo-tagged, has a dated purchase history, and can report issues to a customer service textline in just a tap. Gone are the convoluted point-based rewards. Daily cash is automatically awarded everyday, supporting my need for immediate gratification. Color-based data visualization and captions provide succinct, digestible explanations for opaque financial jargon. Did I mention that Apple Wallet has not once crashed on me nor shown me an infinite loading page? A thoughtful UI revealed that frontend software was a priority, not an afterthought. The aggregation of features that I didn’t know I needed, along with seamless integration, encourage me to make this my go-to card.
            <br></p>
            <p>
                Overall, I think the Apple card was a genius foray into the financial industry. If transparency and privacy is their game, no industry is a better fit. The commitment to privacy is ultimately why I retain the card. There are cards that I could make 5% cash back on, but will then sell my data to the highest bidder. The credit card maintains Apple’s two strongest competitive advantages––a proven commitment to privacy and a fully integrated hardware and software ecosystem––in a market where the line between hardware and software companies are blurring. As hardware innovation slows, Apple must sell the full user experience to stay ahead.
            <br></p>
            <p>
                This card has not changed the credit card landscape. It is an evolutionary, not revolutionary step in the Apple ecosystem.  Since iPhone users are the primary, and probably only, users of this card, I would recommend a new feature that transforms the Apple card into a personal financial assistant, with the help of Siri integration. For example, based on my recent purchases at Everlane and Sweetgreen (and my use of the Apple card), Siri would infer that my values are simplicity and transparency. She could then suggest restaurants or stores that aligned with those values when asked. The feature could also make recurring purchases through partnerships, like prepping my usual Trader Joe’s biweekly groceries for pickup. There would likely be privacy concerns over recommendations, but as long as Apple markets it as an opt-in, locally-stored recommendation engine, the utility and Apple’s privacy reputation would outweigh the concerns.
            <br></p>
            <p>
                Given the resources to incubate an idea in a special projects group, I would recommend a payment concept that would move society along from cashless to cardless to tapless. It would operate like Amazon Go stores that use computer vision the charge your Amazon account automatically instead of using cashiers. The implications of checking out as you shop rather than as you leave the store, at any store, would be far-reaching. There would be less time wasted in line, less opportunity for theft, and more available floor space. Capitalizing on Apple’s wearable hardware instead of software, like the Apple watch, would reinvent the way that customers interact with stores, with fewer privacy concerns than using computer vision. I imagine the outcome would be as disruptive and elegant as when Apple delighted us with the first iMac, iPod, and iPhone.
